                <h1 class="title">Nirvana, Come as You Are</h1>
                <article class="article">
                    <p>"Come as You Are" is a song by American grunge band Nirvana, written by frontman Kurt Cobain. 
                    It is the third track and the second single from the band's second studio album Nevermind, 
                    released in March 1992. It was the band's second and last American top 40 hit, 
                    reaching number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100, and second UK top 10 hit, reaching number nine on the UK Singles Chart. 
                    The single reached the top 10 in eight countries and the top 40 in eleven further countries.</p>

                    <h3 class="header">Background and recording</h3>
                    <p>"Come as You Are" was one of the few new songs Nirvana recorded onto the rehearsal tape
                        the group sent to producer Butch Vig prior to the recording of Nevermind in 1991. 
                        The group recorded the song with Vig during album sessions at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, 
                        California, in early 1991. Cobain recorded his guitar solo in two takes, as well as three takes of vocals, 
                        of which the first was used. Vig then asked Cobain to double track his vocals throughout the entire song. 
                        During the harmony overdub session, Cobain accidentally sang the phrase "And I don't have a gun" too early, 
                        appearing the fourth time he sings the word "memoria" after the guitar solo. 
                        When this mistake was discovered, Cobain decided to keep it in the final recording. 
                        Vig sampled Cobain singing "memoria" from the middle of the song and placed it in the background 
                        of the song near the end twice. The band also performed an acoustic version of the song
                        on MTV Unplugged on November 18, 1993. The recording later appeared on MTV Unplugged 
                        in New York in November 1994.</p>
                    <h3 class="header">Release</h3>
                    <p> Wary of the similarity between the main riff of "Come as You Are" and English post-punk band Killing Joke's 1984 
                        single "Eighties", Nirvana and its management were unsure about releasing the song as 
                        the second single from Nevermind. Danny Goldberg, head of Nirvana's management 
                        Gold Mountain, later revealed that we couldn't decide between 'Come as You Are' 
                        and 'In Bloom.' Kurt was nervous about 'Come as You Are' because it was too similar 
                        to a Killing Joke song but we all thought it was still the better song to go with. 
                        And, he was right, Killing Joke later did complain about it. Nirvana biographer 
                        Everett True writes that "Come as You Are" was eventually chosen for release as 
                        a single because "Goldberg favoured the more obviously commercial song".</p>
